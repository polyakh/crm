## **Monolithic Architecture with REST API**

A **monolithic architecture** integrates all components of the application into a single, unified codebase. This approach is ideal for a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** due to its simplicity and rapid development capabilities.

**Advantages**

•	**Simplicity:** Easier to develop, test, and deploy in the initial stages.

•	**Speed:** Faster development cycles, enabling quicker time-to-market.

•	**Unified Codebase:** Simplifies management and reduces overhead associated with multiple services.

**Considerations**

•	**Scalability:** Plan for future scalability; as the application grows, consider transitioning to a microservices architecture to handle increased complexity and maintain performance.

•	**Maintainability:** Ensure the codebase remains manageable as features are added.

### Feature Improvements

1. gRPC Integration (@grpc/grpc-js & nice-grpc)
   • Current Role: Enables efficient, high-performance inter-service communication via gRPC.
2. Type Safety (ts-proto)
   • Current Role: Provides TypeScript definitions for gRPC services, ensuring consistency and reducing runtime errors.

By leveraging these dependencies, the architecture becomes scalable, secure, and easier to maintain, with enhanced developer productivity.
